# fullstack-business

This repo is intended to show my habilites implementing Spring Boot + React in a Full Stack Development. 
In this particular case I've develop a project for the wine brand "Indeleble" to handle and have a register of their suppliers, clients and employees.
I've been following Mr. Lucas Moy channel while I implement my own way to code, develop it and get to the same result. Whether it's using different techniques or annotations as well as implementing another type of Database and so on.
